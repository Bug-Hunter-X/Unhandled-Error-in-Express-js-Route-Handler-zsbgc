This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file shows a route that is vulnerable to errors if the user ID is not a number or if no user with that ID exists. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
